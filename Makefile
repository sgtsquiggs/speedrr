# speedrr maintenance tasks.
#
# Python work runs through `uv run` so the locked environment is used rather
# than whatever happens to be on PATH. Container and tower targets deliberately
# do not, since they must work before `uv sync` has run.
#
# `check` mirrors ci.yml's five steps (sync, lint, fmt-check, typecheck, test),
# in that order. Its recipe issues them as sequential $(MAKE) calls rather than
# as a prerequisite list: recipe lines within a single target always run one
# after another, regardless of -j, whereas prerequisites of one target are
# fair game for `make -j` to run concurrently. That matters here because each
# step invokes `uv run`, which implicitly syncs the venv against uv.lock -
# several of those firing at once against the same .venv would race.
